# New York Magazine News & Politics Menu Equity Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that restores equity to the nymag.com News & Politics menu.

The nymag.com "News & Politics" dropdown menu displays Jonathan Chait's name
in bold, while the other writers are relegated to normal weight. This is unfair,
and seems to be solely due to a perfect storm of CSS that bolds the top two
menu items on every menu plus the order of columnists being alphabetical by
surname.

The solution is simple and obvious: Unbold Jonathan Chait's name, affirming once
and for all that Marin, Ed, Annie, Frank, Chris, and Rebecca are equally valued
members of the team.
