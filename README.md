# New York Magazine News & Politics Menu Equity Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that restores equity to the nymag.com News & Politics menu.

The nymag.com "News & Politics" dropdown menu displays Jonathan Chait's name
in bold, while the other writers are relegated to normal weight. This is
unfair.

The solution: Unbold Jonathan Chait's name, affirming once and for all that
Marin, Ed, Annie, Frank, Chris, and Rebecca are equally valued members of the
team.

It's easy to nitpick other people's code, decisions, and priorities. Working
on the actual bugs in my own CMS is not so easy, somehow.
